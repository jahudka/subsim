# Parameters and options reference

## Simulation options

Simulation options can be adjusted by expanding the bottom panel and then
switching to the _"options"_ tab.

| Option         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frequency      | The frequency at which the simulation is computed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Gain           | This is basically a common gain trim applied to all sources. You can use it if you want to simulate a smaller area and the entire plot is awash with red.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Range          | This option allows you to adjust the dynamic range of the simulation. The color spectrum used to render the plot will stretch over the configured range; any values below the range will simply use the same purple color as the lowest value in the range.                                                                                                                              |
| Step           | This allows you to switch between a smooth color gradient and two stepped isobaric modes, one with a step of 3dB and the other 6dB. The isobaric modes, while not quite as easy on the eye as the gradient mode, are very useful in determining areas with a similar SPL. You can also quickly cycle between all three modes by clicking the range legend at the top left of the screen. |
| Speed of sound | The speed of sound, in meters per second, to use in the simulation; it is also available in any _expressions_ as the variable `$c`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |


## Sources

Sources are managed using the _"sources"_ tab, accessible by expanding the
bottom panel.

| Parameter    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| on           | Whether the source is included in the simulation or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| x, y, angle  | The position and rotation of the source in the simulation area. Note that this is the position of the idealised point source, which is idealised to be located in the center of the front grille of the speaker, since that will probably be the closest approximation for generic speakers. |
| width, depth | The size of the physical speaker. This is currently just a visual guide, it doesn't affect the simulation.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| delay        | The delay time set for this source, in ms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| invert       | Flips the polarity of the source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| pattern      | The polar pattern of the source.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |


## Guides

Guides are configured on the _"guides"_ tab in the bottom panel.

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type          | 'rect' or 'line'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| x, y, angle   | The position and rotation of the guide. For rectangular guides, this is the position of the center of the rectangle; for lines, it is a point through which the line must pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| width, height | The width and height of rectangular guides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| reflect       | Whether a line guide should reflect sound. This is currently implemented by just mirroring all active sources along the line, which means that the resulting plot will still show audio on both sides of the line, but you can just ignore the side you don't care about. Also, multiple reflecting lines don't interact - each line will simply mirror the original sources, and that's that. Basically it should tell you what first reflections will do, which (especially in outdoors settings, where you may have just a building on one side or something similar) should be useful info. |
| absorption    | When a line guide has reflections enabled, this parameter adjusts the initial gain of the generated reflected sources. A value `<0` will be interpreted as attenuation in dB; a value `>=0` will be interpreted as an absorption coefficient the way it is usually specified for materials, i.e. ratio of absorbed energy to incident energy. A coefficient of `0` means no absorption, while a coefficient of `1` means total absorption.                                                                                                                                                      |
| color, label  | The color and label of the guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
