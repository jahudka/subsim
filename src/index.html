          <h3>What is Subsim?</h3>
          <p>
            This tool is a bare-bones theoretical simulator of how multiple
            subwoofers should sum in a given open area. It allows you to
            place different sources of audio into a defined area
            and adjust their settings, such as gain, phase flip, or delay;
            the plot will show you how the audio would propagate through the
            area and what the resulting amplitude at each point should be.

          <h3>Some important things</h3>
          <p>
            I developed this simulator while I was trying to learn about
            subwoofer arrays myself, and while I'm reasonably confident that
            the math is right and that the predictions the simulator outputs
            should be pretty accurate, it bears saying that I'm not an authority
            on any of this - I possess high-school level math skills at best,
            I'm not an actual engineer with a degree or anything like that -
            so it must be said that this tool comes with no guarantees of
            any sort. It might be spot on, or it might be completely wrong.
            But hopefully as a quick &amp; dirty tool for learning the basics
            it might just do the trick.
          </p>

          <h3>How it works</h3>
          <p>
            The simulator runs in 2D only and the simulation area represents
            a birds-eye view of an open field, that is, there are no walls
            which would generate reflections in the real world (although there
            is a tool which can add walls, to some extent - we'll get back to
            that). There is also no attempt to simulate things like the speed
            of sound changing based on weather conditions (although you can
            adjust it manually if you're so inclined). Like I said, <i>bare-bones</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The simulation is always run at one defined frequency, which you can
            adjust in the Simulation options section. For each point in the plot
            the distance to each source is computed; from the source distance
            we can get two things: the gain factor (<code>1 / distance</code>)
            and, based on the speed of sound and the source delay, if any, we can
            get the arrival time, and from that we can get the phase offset for
            that source at the defined frequency. Then it's just a matter of summing
            the signals to produce the resulting gain factor and picking a suitable
            color.
          </p>
          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <p>
            Click the V-shaped button at the top of the page to open the Project
            menu; there is a number of predefined example projects you can check
            out. Some are parametric - they have some parameters set using variables
            that you can change in the <i>Variables</i> section.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also create your own projects. They will be saved in your browser
            for later use, but beware that there is no autosave function - remember
            to hit that "Save" button when you're happy with your settings!

          <h3>Building blocks</h3>
          <dl>
            <dt>Sources</dt>
            <dd>
              The most important part of the simulator are the <i>sources</i> - these
              represent individual speakers as idealised point sources.
            </dd>
            <dt>Guides</dt>
            <dd>
              Guides are visual helpers you can use to help you visualise the space
              in which you're working - you can e.g. add a stage or an FOH and similar things.
              Importantly, though, the <i>line</i> guides can also be used to affect
              the simulation: they can be used to reflect the sound, like a wall would.
              See below for more info on that.
            </dd>
            <dt>Expressions</dt>
            <dd>
              All numeric parameters of both <i>sources</i> and <i>guides</i> can actually
              be represented using an <i>expression</i>, rather than just a number.
              Expressions can contain <i>variables</i>, like <code>$c</code> for the speed
              of sound, but you can also define your own variables. There is also a number
              of <i>functions</i> you can call in expressions - see below for a reference.
              This allows you to e.g. define a variable representing the frequency for which
              you're tuning your array and then specify all the spatial offsets and time delays
              of your sources as a function of that frequency - meaning that if you want to
              try a different frequency, you just adjust that one variable, and your entire
              array will reconfigure automatically. All the numeric parameters will by default
              show their computed numeric values; you can hover over parameters to show a tooltip
              with the original expressions. This will switch while you're editing a parameter:
              the parameter field will then contain the expression, and the tooltip will show
              the computed value.

            <dt>Resolution</dt>
            <dd>
              The resolution of the simulation, in pixels. Essentially the lower this number
              is, the more detailed the resulting plot will be, but also more computationally
              intensive. If the simulation feels too sluggish when changing parameters, you can
              try increasing this value a little.

              of the front grille of the speaker, since that will probably be the closest approximation

            <dd>'rect' or 'line'</dd>
            <dt>x, y, angle</dt>
            <dd>
              The position and rotation of the guide. For rectangular guides, this is the position of the
              center of the rectangle; for lines, it is a point through which the line must pass.

            <dd>The width and height of rectangular guides.</dd>
            <dt>reflect</dt>
            <dd>
              Whether a line guide should reflect sound.
              This is currently implemented by just mirroring all active sources along
              the line, which means that the resulting plot will still show audio
              on both sides of the line, but you can just ignore the side you don't
              care about. Also, multiple reflecting lines don't interact - each line
              will simply mirror the original sources, and that's that. Basically
              it should tell you what first reflections will do, which (especially
              in outdoors settings, where you may have just a building on one side
              or something similar) should be useful info.
            </dd>
            <dt>absorption</dt>
            <dd>
              When a line guide has reflections enabled, this parameter adjusts the
              initial gain of the generated reflected sources. A value <code>&lt;0</code>
              will be interpreted as attenuation in dB; a value <code>&gt;=0</code> will be
              interpreted as an absorption coefficient the way it is usually specified
              for materials, i.e. ratio of the absorbed energy to the incident energy.
              A coefficient of <code>0</code> means no absorption, while a coefficient
              of <code>1</code> means total absorption.
