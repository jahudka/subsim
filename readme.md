# Subsim - a subwoofer array simulator

This is an extremely simplified simulator of subwoofer arrays.
I mostly wrote it to learn how subwoofer arrays work, so take
it with a grain (or perhaps a truckload, really) of salt.

It is intended more as a "textbook companion" than a tool for
actual engineers to use in the field - there are probably _vastly_
more things going on in the real world than this thing attempts
to simulate - but to help you get the basic concepts it should
hopefully be adequate.
